<p>Hello! I'm Julia Solórzano — a Program Manager leading the <a href="https://standards.digital.gov">Federal Website Standards program</a>, where I focus on creating seamless digital experiences and building high-performing teams. I direct cross-functional teams in delivering usable, consistent and accessible government services that impact millions of users across federal agencies. Throughout my career at organizations like GSA, Zapier, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, I've championed human-centered design, built innovative design systems, and mentored countless practitioners. I'm particularly energized by solving complex challenges in civic technology, working with open-source communities, and helping agencies deliver amazing digital services that meet the needs of all Americans.</p>

<p>Want to work together? <a href="mailto:hello@juliasolorzano.com">I’d love to hear from you</a>.</p>
